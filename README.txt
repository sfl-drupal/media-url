Media URL
=========

Provides editors with an easy way to retrieve a media URL to use it in a text editor.

When using Media, it can be difficult for an editor to know the actual URL of an uploaded media. One solution could be, for instance, to go to the file page (i.e file/fid) and inspect the document or copy the image URL, in case of an image. It is a tedious task that can bother content editors. Besides, when using Media Browser Plus, which provides nice UI improvements over the standard media library, it gets even more harder to get to the media page.

This is kind of an helper module that:

* Displays the media URL on the media edit form
* Optionnaly display the media URL on the media page
* Optionnaly display the media URL in a system message after the upload

It allows to display the standard URL, or the URL-encoded one.
